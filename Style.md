This will need to be cleaned up, with examples and such:

Imports
=======

* Only import frameworks, the superclass, and protocols in headers
* Forward declarations in the header for project-level classes you need there
* Import all the classes you use in the implementation
* Imports are grouped by/in the order: (superclass) (framework-level) (project-level)

Spacing
=======

* No spaces after keywords or functions
* Spaces after commas in lists
* No spaces immediately inside parentheses
* Spaces on both sides of the pointer asterisk
* Braces go on their own line

Private Methods
===============

* Private methods are declared on an anonymous category
